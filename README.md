# Grounded Segment Anything: From Objects to Parts

In this repo, we expand [Segment Anything Model](https://segment-anything.com/) (SAM) to support text prompt input. The text prompt could be object-level:full_moon: (eg, dog) and part-level:last_quarter_moon: (eg, dog head). Furthermoreï¼Œwe build a [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt)-based dialogue system :robot::speech_balloon: that flexibly calls various segmentation models when receiving instructions in the form of natural language.

## :sparkles::sparkles: Highlights :sparkles::sparkles:

Beyond class-agnostic mask segmentation, this repo contains:

- Grounded segment anything at both **object** level and ***part*** level.
- Interacting with models in the form of **natural language**.

These abilities come from a series of models, including:

| Model | Function |
| ----  | -------- |
| [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) | Segment anything from prompt |
| [GLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP) | Grounded language-image pre-training |
| [Visual ChatGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt) | Connects ChatGPT and segmentation foundation models |
| :star:**VLPart**:star: (*under review*) | Going denser with open-vocabulary part segmentation |


### FAQ

**Q:** When will VLPart paper be released ?

**A:** The paper is under internal review and it will be released in about one month. Please stay tuned.


**Q:** What is the difference between [Grounded SAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything) and this project ?

**A:** Grounded SAM is Grounded DINO + SAM, and this project is GLIP/VLPart + SAM. We believe any open-vocabulary (text prompt) object detection model can be used to combine with SAM.

## Usage

### Install

See [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).



### :robot::speech_balloon: Integration with Visual ChatGPT

```bash
# prepare your private OpenAI key (for Linux)
export OPENAI_API_KEY={Your_Private_Openai_Key}
python chatbot.py --load "ImageCaptioning_cuda:0, SegmentAnything_cuda:1, PartPromptSegmentAnything_cuda:1, ObjectPromptSegmentAnything_cuda:0"
```

### :last_quarter_moon: Prompt Segment Anything at Part Level

```bash

wget https://github.com/Cheems-Seminar/segment-anything-and-name-it/releases/download/v1.0/swinbase_part_0a0000.pth
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth

python demo_vlpart_sam.py --input_image assets/twodogs.jpeg --output_dir outputs_demo --text_prompt "dog head"
```
Result:

### :full_moon: Prompt Segment Anything at Object Level

```bash
wget https://github.com/Cheems-Seminar/segment-anything-and-name-it/releases/download/v1.0/glip_large.pth

python demo_glip_sam.py --input_image assets/demo2.jpeg --output_dir outputs_demo --text_prompt "frog"

```

Result:

###  :lollipop: Multi-Prompt

For multiple prompts, seperate each prompt with `.`, for example, `--text_prompt "dog head. dog nose"`
